# Two-Player-Game
This simulates a two-player image guessing game where players take turns guessing the image's name, with each correct guess revealing a random percentage of the image until it's fully uncovered and declaring a winner.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate OOP concepts, networking principles through client-server communication, efficient file handling, and game logic involving recursion and backtracking. 
It also highlights multithreading capabilities for managing concurrent interactions.
